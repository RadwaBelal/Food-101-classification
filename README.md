# Food-101-classification
Using the Food-101 dataset, we were tasked with implementing two models to classify images based on their features. We successfully implemented EfficientNet B3, achieving an accuracy of approximately 82%, and ResNet-18, with an accuracy of around 74%. Our process began with loading the dataset and understanding its contents. We then resized the images, divided them into batches for effective training, and visualized random images from different batches each time the code was run. Finally, we created the training and validation functions to be used in the main implementation.
